The game consists of a file ended with .DAT
The first line is the grid
The second is the coordinates of Tom and Jerry (X,Y) respectively
From the third line forward, each pair is a set of coordinates (X,Y) representing Upper Left Corner and Lower Right Corner of the obstacles.

The root folder (Tom-and-Jerry-game) opens as a NetBeans project, possibly with the name "prFinal".
