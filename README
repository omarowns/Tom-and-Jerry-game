The game consists of a file ended with .DAT
The first line is the grid
The second is the coordinates of Tom and Jerry (X,Y) respectively
From the third line forward, each pair is a set of coordinates (X,Y) representing Upper Left Corner and Lower Right Corner of the obstacles.

The root folder (Tom-and-Jerry-game) opens as a NetBeans project, possibly with the name "prFinal".

The project updated on 12/12/2011 to it's ALPHA version. This means (at least to me) that the project is finished
and working on almost all of it's features.
  -> Test 1 works ok since a week ago.
  -> Test 2 works ok since last update:
      - Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path works
      - There is a graphical visualization of Tom, Jerry, the obstacles (if any) and the shortest path (if any)
